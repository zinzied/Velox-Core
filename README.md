# Velox-Core ⚡
**The High-Performance Middleware Engine for LLMs**

Velox is not just another API wrapper. It is a **motor** designed for professional AI developers who need control, observability, and resilience.

## 🌟 Why Velox?

Building production-grade AI applications is more than just sending a prompt to OpenAI. It requires handling complex infrastructure challenges that often clutter business logic. We built Velox to solve these core pain points:

1.  **The "Spaghetti Pipeline" Problem**: Most developers manually chain retries, logs, and caches. Velox uses a **Middleware Architecture** (inspired by Express.js/FastAPI) to keep your code clean and modular.
2.  **Uncontrolled Costs**: High-end models like GPT-4 are expensive. Velox's **Semantic Router** automatically diverts trivial fluff to cheaper models, while the **Cost Optimizer** prevents recursive agents from draining your budget.
3.  **Privacy & Compliance**: Sending user data to third-party LLMs is a risk. **PII Guard** ensures sensitive data (emails, phones, credit cards) is redacted *before* it leaves your infrastructure.
4.  **Observability Vacuum**: Standard SDKs don't tell you why a request failed or how much it actually cost in real-time. Velox's **Advanced Dashboard** provides a "Hacker-style" TUI for live telemetry.

## 🆕 New in v0.1.0

We've just supercharged Velox with these powerful additions:
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), Mistral, and Groq.
- **Semantic Routing**: Native intelligence to route simple prompts to cheaper models automatically.
- **PII Guard**: Built-in regex engine to redact sensitive information before it hits the cloud.
- **Cost Optimizer**: Strict USD budget enforcement at the middleware level.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/velox-core
cd velox-core

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Usage Guide

Velox is designed to be progressive. Start simple, then stack power.

### 1. The Fundamental Motor
The simplest way to get started. Just a provider and a prompt.

```python
import asyncio
from velox.core.engine import Velox
from velox.providers.mock import MockProvider

async def main():
    motor = Velox()
    motor.use(MockProvider(response_text="Ignition successful."))
    
    response = await motor.prompt("Status?")
    print(f"Velox: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 2. The Production Stack (Security & Speed)
This is how you use Velox in a real app: layered with security and optimization.

```python
from velox.core.engine import Velox
from velox.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider
from velox.layers import (
    AdvancedDashboardLayer, 
    PIIGuardLayer, 
    SemanticRouterLayer,
    CostOptimizerLayer
)

async def main():
    motor = Velox()
    
    # Order matters: Redact -> Route -> Limit -> Log
    motor.add(PIIGuardLayer())               # 1. Zero-trust PII masking
    motor.add(SemanticRouterLayer(           # 2. Fast-path trivial queries
        simple_model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        threshold_chars=40 
    ))
    motor.add(CostOptimizerLayer(            # 3. Budget safety net
        max_cost_usd=0.05, 
        per_request=True 
    ))
    motor.add(AdvancedDashboardLayer())      # 4. Live telemetry UI
    
    motor.use(OpenAIProvider(model="gpt-4o"))
    
    # If this message contains an email, it's redacted before GPT-4 sees it.
    # If the message is just "Hi", it stays on GPT-3.5.
    await motor.prompt("My email is ceo@company.com, summarize this project.")
```

### 3. Agentic & Shadow Mode
Test new models in the background without affecting users.

```python
from velox.layers.shadow import ShadowLayer

# Main model handles the user. 
# Shadow model (Llama-3) runs in parallel; 
# results are logged for performance comparison.
motor.add(ShadowLayer(llama_provider, name="Llama-Testing"))
motor.use(gpt4_provider)
```

## 🧩 Supported Providers

Velox is engine-agnostic. Use any of the major providers with a consistent interface:

| Provider | Class | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OpenAI** | `OpenAIProvider` | Native SDK integration |
| **Anthropic** | `AnthropicProvider` | High-speed `httpx` implementation |
| **Google** | `GoogleGeminiProvider` | Official Gemini SDK support |
| **Mistral** | `MistralProvider` | OpenAI-compatible via `httpx` |
| **Groq** | `GroqProvider` | Ultra-fast inference via `httpx` |

## 🧩 Middleware Layers Table

| Layer | Purpose | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PIIGuardLayer` | **Data Privacy** | Automatic Regex-based PII redaction (Email, Phone, etc.) |
| `SemanticRouterLayer`| **Intelligence** | Routes prompts to different models based on complexity |
| `CostOptimizerLayer` | **Safety** | Enforces budget limits in USD to prevent overspending |
| `AdvancedDashboard` | **Observability** | Live Hacker-style TUI with metrics and telemetry |
| `AutoToolingLayer` | **Agentic** | Simplifies function calling and tool orchestration |
| `ShadowLayer` | **Testing** | Runs background models for A/B performance comparison |
| `RetryLayer` | **Resilience** | Configurable exponential backoff for API failures |
| `CacheLayer` | **Efficiency** | Exact and Semantic caching to save time/tokens |
